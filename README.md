# DCS-Essex
Essex class carrier CVA-31 Bon Homme Richard for DCS.

The model is based on a mod by karla for IL-2 1946: https://www.sas1946.com/main/index.php/topic,46424.0.html

It has been brought to Arma 3 by NightIntruder and myself: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2536035098

Odyseus has updated the original model and develops it further.
