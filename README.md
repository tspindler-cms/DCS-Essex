# DCS-Essex
Essex class carrier CVA-31 Bon Homme Richard for DCS.

The model is based on a mod by karla for IL-2 1946: https://www.sas1946.com/main/index.php/topic,46424.0.html

It has been brought to Arma 3 by NightIntruder and myself: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2536035098

Odyseus has updated the original model and develops it further.
TheSn4k3 provided the catapult shuttle and wire.

Thanks to Joey45, Admiral189 and Hawkeye60 for all the help and advice on getting this boat afloat in DCS.

Final thanks to Citizen, tester of the mod.

The carrier will be published in the Vietnam War Vessels mod, https://github.com/tspindler-cms/tetet-vwv
